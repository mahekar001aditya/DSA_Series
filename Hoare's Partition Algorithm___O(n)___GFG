Hoare's Partition Algorithm
Given an array arr[], the task is to partition the array by assuming first element as pivot element.

The partition of an array must satisfy the following two conditions:

Elements smaller than pivot element must appear at index less than or equal to partition index.
Elements larger than or equal to pivot element must appear at index greater than partition index.
Partition index is equal to count of elements, strictly smaller than pivot, minus one.

Note: There might me more than one possible partition arrays.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1, 10]
Output: [1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 10] 
Explanation: The partition index is 3 and pivot element is 5, all elements smaller than pivot element [1, 3, 2, 4] were arranged before partition index and elements larger than or equal to pivot [8, 7, 5, 10] were arranged after partition index.

Input: arr[] = [12, 10, 9, 16, 19, 9]
Output: [9, 10, 9, 16, 19, 12] 
Explanation: The partition index is 2 and pivot element is 12, all elements smaller than pivot element [9, 10, 9] were arranged before or at partition index and elements larger than or equal to pivot [16, 19, 12] were arranged after partition index.
